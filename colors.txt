5. Web Application UI/UX Considerations

* Dashboard Layout: Clean, organized cards and sections, emphasizing data clarity.
* Typography: Stick to chosen fonts, ensuring excellent readability.
* Iconography: Line-based, minimalist icons. The accent teal-green can be used for active or interactive icons.
* Data Visualization: Charts should be clean, using the secondary color palette intelligently to differentiate data points without being overwhelming.
* User Feedback: A clear use of color for success (accent teal-green), warning (muted orange), and error messages (a complementary red like #D9534F).
* Transitions & Animations: Subtle, smooth animations that mimic seamlessness, like elements "stitching" together or flowing.
